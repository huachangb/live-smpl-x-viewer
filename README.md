# Live viewer for SMPL-X models

Simple implementation to view SMPL-X parameter changes dynamically. 
Only supports global orientation for now.

The code for viewing the SMPL-X models is very simplistic and is only meant (for me while writing the code for this) to gain a better understanding of the SMPL-X model.
